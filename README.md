# Overview

ActiveMQ broker runs somewhere, possibly on the RaspberryPI. A script subscribes to a topic
providing messages that tell it what to do. There will be a different topic for each kind
of control message. Messages are published to this topic from a variety of sources:
* A web server application that publishes messages based on invocation of its REST API methods.
  An IPhone scans a QR Code that contains a URL with one of the REST API calls and publishes a
  corresponding message to the AMQ Broker.
* A stand-alone script on a Pi-Zero with a RFID reader publishes a message containing selected parts
  of the data in the RFID token. Like a "wand".
  
The MQTT messages do things like:
* Start playing a playlist item, the item index provided in the message. Does the message contain
  an index or does it name a item, e.g. a mp3 file? In the first instance, the message just has
  an index; what this does is determined by the receiver.
* Stop playing the current playlist item
* Pause/Resume the current playlist item
* Reset

All the messages are JSON and follow the same format, which is TBD

# Packages
## client_player

This subscribes to the topic and executes actions specified in the messages, e.g. to play an MP3.
It needs to:
* Connect to an MQTT broker (mqtt protocol)
* Read in a playlist that maps an index to the path to an Audio file
* Execute the actions specified in the messages
* Connect and re-connect to the broker

Configuration
* The host and port of the AMQ broker
* The topic to subscribe to
* The playlist that maps index to Audio file

## HTTP to MQTT Bridge
This is a web server application. The main endpoint for this application does this:
* Connects and re-connects to an MQTT broker
* Receives a request that has a topic + data, e.g. an integer which is the playlist index
* It packs the data into a JSON message and publishes to the specified topic

Configuration:
* The IP and port to listen on
* The host and port of the MQTT broker
* The topic to publish to

There are two test drivers used to explore how to pub/sub and deal with the broker connection
failing. `pub_mqtt_driver.py` and `sub_mqt_driver.py`

# Docker Stuff
This assumes Docker community edition is installed which it is.

## Run Portainer in Docker

[https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/deploy/ceinstalldocker/](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/deploy/ceinstalldocker/)

## Run MQTT Broker in docker

* [Eclipse MQTT](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto)

## Making the music_player component run on Raspberry PI. 

* Problem with qrcode module needing Python >=3.8 when the PI has only 3.7.x installed. Solution
was basically that qrcode is not needed in the music_player, it is for making QRCodes and doesn't need
to run on the PI, this is something that will be run only on the desktop.
* Next problem was that pygame couldn't find libsdl2-mixer-2.0.so.0. Solution to this was simply to
install it.
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libsdl2-mixer-2.0
  ```
* The music player had same problem running tasks in paralell that the qr-gateway had, the tasks seemed to be running series -- because
there was a block on getting results from each function. The comms function failed because the host name was missing a hyphen but
the log message was not visible. Changing to the no_block version of the function worked and the error message was printed out,
easy fix to the hostname.
* The music could not play because the file does not exist, none of the ones in the playlist are available. So... it didn't
play but then after some tens of seconds there this this error
```
ALSA lib pcm.c:8424:(snd_pcm_recover) underrun occurred
```
And it happened over and over, I guess the sound hardware was started up but given nothing to play.
* There is one WAV file that is copied to the pi, and that one did in fact play. Volume control works. Amazing.
