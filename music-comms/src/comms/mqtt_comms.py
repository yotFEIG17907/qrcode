"""
A class to wrap dealing with the MQTT broker
Background reading: http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/into-mqtt-python-client/
Note: if connection is successful but then fails almost immediately on the first subscribe
action with errors that end with "Out of Memory", then check that the client id is unique,
you could easily be running more than instance of the same program using the same client ID.
